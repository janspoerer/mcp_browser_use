  1. Fixed the Windows Chrome launch bug - Modified chrome.py to skip the process exit check on Windows, since Chrome's    
   launcher always exits immediately after spawning background processes.
  2. Changed to a non-default user data directory - Used C:\Users\j.spoerer\ChromeBetaMCP instead of the default Chrome    
   Beta directory to avoid remote debugging restrictions.
  3. Installed extensions - Copied extensions to the new profile.
  4. Successfully tested - Chrome Beta is now running and can navigate to websites.

  Current Configuration:
  - Browser: Chrome Beta 142.0.7444.34
  - User Data Dir: C:\Users\j.spoerer\ChromeBetaMCP
  - Profile: Default
  - Debug Port: 9225
  - Extensions: Enabled
  - Headless: No (headed mode)

  The MCP browser is now ready for use! You can scrape websites with Chrome Beta and extensions will be available as needed.
